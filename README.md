hitting a ball clames that call as yours and changes it to your color. If a ball that is your color breaks a brick you get points, but if it hits the ground you lose a life.

Person with the most points after both people lose all 5 lives is declared the winner.

Sorry I dont still have the source. This is a project I did in late 2010 for a course that I just came across in some old files.
